# sinon-chai-calls-assertion

A simple assertion to validate many aspects of stub calls

## How it works

### expectCall

Will validate the exactly interaction with the mocked method, which is:
* How many times has been called;
* Which parameters have been passed to it;
* In what order the calls happened.
